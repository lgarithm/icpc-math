The ACM/ICPC(International Collegiate Programming Contest,
auspices by Association for Computing Machinery), is an annual contest
which is popular among college students of computer science and some related majors.

Every year in October, November and December, regional contests will be held all over the world
to select teams to advanced to the world final contest next year.
Before the regional contests, many universities will hold their school contests,
or subregional contests, also inviting teams from other universities to compete together.

As you can see in the ICPC logo, the contest is just like a game.
Every three students form a team to solve problems using only one computer,
once a problem is solved, they will be given a balloon with corresponding color.

Every problem has a simple, fast and wrong solution.

\subsection{Traing Strategies: Make Use of Online Judges}
There are many online judges(OJ) on the Internet, and They are all open and free.
Anyone who wants to do practise can register for an account and submit solutions to judge.
Here is a list of famous online judges:
\begin{itemize}
	\item POJ, \verb|http://poj.org/|
	\item ZOJ, \verb|http://acm.zju.edu.cn/onlinejudge/|
	\item TJU, \verb|http://acm.tju.edu.cn/|
	\item HDU, \verb|http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/|
	\item SOJ, \verb|http://cs.scu.edu.cn/soj/|
	\item SGU, \verb|http://acm.sgu.ru/|
	\item URAL, \verb|http://acm.timus.ru/|
	\item USACO, \verb|http://ace.delos.com/usacogate|
\end{itemize}
We will use the shortcuts in this book.
E.g. SOJ1001 means the problem on SOJ with ID 1001.

\subsection{Setup Your Work Environment}
The IDEs are: DEV C++, C-Free, Eclipse.

\subsubsection{Install the Compiler}
For windows users, I highly recomend you use the cygwin.
You can download a strawberry perl, and use the gcc/g++ within it.

\subsubsection{Start to Use the Colsole}
Use stdio redirect to run test data.
Use the \verb|fc| commmand to check the answer.
